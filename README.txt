Description
Program to count the number of unique characters in a given file within a specified range and print out the results. I accomplished this by creating an array large enough to store all characters in correct range from the ASCII table. Every time a character is encountered, the data at the index corresponding the that character's position in the ASCII table is incremented. Then in the printData() method, the index is casted to a character and printed along with the number of occurences and that number of hashes.
